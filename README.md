# chauffeur-tracker-service Documentation

A Restful API web service that enables busy people to manage their weekly driving responsibilities and schedule drop-offs and collections. You can track when and where you want to go, and at what time to pick up your family.

This *mock* API is designed to simulate the REST interface of an imaginary service.

## Documentation

For the REST API docs, see the [Chauffeur Tracker documentation](https://sinecoug.github.io/chauffeur-tracker-service/). Docs are presented as a GitHub Pages site.
