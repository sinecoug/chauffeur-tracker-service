# Quickstart guide

Are you looking for a way to plan and track your family's transport needs?

Easily manage all your pick-up and drop-off schedules in the Chauffeur Tracker!

## At a glance

This Quickstart provides all the information you need to begin using Chauffeur Tracker to track your family's driving schedules.

You’ll learn about hosting a secure web service and how to make your first call to the API.

## Base URL

The Chauffeur Tracker API is served over HTTPS. All URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base: https://{server_url}.

The {server_url} variable depends on users' installation of the service in their development environment. For v1 of Chauffeur Tracker service, the {server_url} variable is typically set to <http://localhost>.

## Security

At its heart, API security requires that the caller provides:

- an authenticated identity (the *authentication*), and
- evidence that the caller has permission to access the resources (the *authorization*).

The Chauffeur Tracker service is an imaginary, *simulated* service. While it doesn't follow all the access and restriction rules, the service does implement HTTP Basic Auth, which is a classic lock-and-key security model that's simple and widely used. Basic Auth requires a username and password combination that's Base64 encoded and sent in the HTTP Authorization header of a request.

In HTTP Basic Auth, the server-side application expects an Authorization header that contains a username and a password.

If it doesn't receive it, it returns an HTTP 401 "Unauthorized" error.

## Make your first API call – *List all driving schedules*

Assume that you’re already enrolled in the Chauffeur Tracker service and you want to list all driving schedules as a first call to the API.

Let’s test making this simple request to the [`schedules`](../reference/schedules.md) resource.  You’ll use cURL to make the API call, and for Basic Auth, include the -u parameter to bypass the username and password and return the response without errors.

```bash

curl -u user:pass http://localhost:3000/schedules
```

If the call was successful, the response you receive will be a list of schedules from the Chauffeur Tracker service such as you see in this example:
