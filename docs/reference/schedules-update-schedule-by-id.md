# Update a schedule for a specific driver

Updates a driver's [`schedules`](schedules) object in the database.

For example, you want to update properties associated with schedule *id=6* in the database.

Assumption: to update the correct schedule, you must know the schedule `Id` to query.

The request body contains the updated schedule details.

## URL

```shell

{server_url}/schedules/{id}
```

## Method

{PUT}

## Query parameters

| Property | Description | Type | Required | Notes |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------ |------------ |------------ |
| `Id` | The record ID of the schedule to return.  | number | Required |  |

## Request headers

| Header name | Description | Required | Values |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------ |------------ |
| Basic Auth | A security checkpoint that requires transmission of a username and password with every request. | Required | Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme that's built into the HTTP protocol. See the Quickstart > Security section.|
| Content-Type | The format of the data to be posted. | Optional | application/json. Default value.  |
| Accept | The format of the data to be returned. | Optional | application/json. Default value. |

## Request body

In the request body, specify a JSON representation of the [`schedules`](schedules) object. The following table lists the properties that are required when you create a schedule.

**IMPORTANT:**
With a {PUT} call, the request body replaces the current properties of the [`schedules`](schedules) object.

To update/replace single property instances in the [`schedules`](schedules) object, use a {PATCH} call in your [schedules request](schedules-update-schedule-by-property.md).
