Effortlessly manage your family's driving schedule!

The Chauffeur Tracker service provides a cloud-hosted convenient service for managing a family's driving responsibilities and scheduling pick-ups and drop-offs.

**NOTE:**
Chauffeur Tracker is an imaginary, *simulated* web service. The API endpoints are intended to reflect true behavior in production. If you wish, you can set up your local development environment to run API calls and test the documentation.
